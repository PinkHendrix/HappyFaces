Create unique generative art by using the canvas api and node js. Before you use the generation engine, make sure you have node.js installed.

Before installing node.js what worked for me (on 2020 M1 MacBook) was installing nvm first through CLI code, follow this instructions here:

Scroll to the message from user "ezdouglas," it was the only thing that worked for me.
